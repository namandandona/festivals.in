Therefore, this time signifies a period of socializing and families enjoying each other’s company.</p><p>Worshippers usually bathe in sacred rivers such as the Ganga, Yamuna, Godavari, Krishna, and Cauvery on this day. For believers, taking a dip absolves them of their sins; it is also seen as a time of peace and prosperity, and countless spiritual deeds are performed on this day. Sesame and jaggery ladoos or chikkis are distributed on this day to symbolise the desire for people to live in peace and harmony.</p><p>In Karnataka, young girls dress up in brand new clothes and exchange goodies with friends and family. Traditionally, a tray is filled with a bowl of the delicious “Ellu Bella” made of sesame seeds and jaggery, sugarcane, coconut, banana, and sugar candy moulds.Beautiful and colourful rangolis are drawn in front of homes on the day of Sankranti. In rural regions, cows and bulls are washed, decorated, and worshipped.Another tradition of Makar Sankranti rejoiced by kids is kite flying.
